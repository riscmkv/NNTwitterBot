# NN Twitter Bot

This github repository is BASED and is yanderedev levels of spaghetti

Neural net code can be found in resnext.py.

Twitter bot code can be found in twitterBotAPI.py. Authorization keys obviously not uploaded to github.

The file structure of the bot is poorly named:

- ./fan_submit: After the bot scrapes new messages, follower submissions are added to this folder
- ./submissions: This is where I add my own "curated" memes. It's not actually submissions.
- ./submissions_completed: After an image is posted, it is moved into this folder.
